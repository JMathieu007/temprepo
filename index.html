      <h1>Hi, I’m Joshua.</h1>
      <p>
        I’m a U.S. Army veteran turned technologist and builder. I care about
        doing hard things on purpose, building systems that actually work, and
        helping people get unstuck in their own lives.

      <h2 id="work-heading">What I’m building right now</h2>
      <p>
        I’m in a season of building. A few of the things I’ve been working on:
      </p>
      <ul style="margin-left: 1.2rem; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
        <li>
          <strong>Cybersecurity & compliance tooling:</strong>
          creating practical tools that make complex frameworks (like RMF and
          NIST 800-53) less painful and more automated.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Task & habit systems:</strong>
          experimenting with gamified ways to track daily tasks, XP, and long-term goals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Writing & self-development content:</strong>
          turning hard lessons from the military, tech, and life into
          straight-forward advice people can actually use.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Background / story -->
    <section aria-labelledby="story-heading">
      <h2 id="story-heading">A bit of my story</h2>
      <p>
        I started in the military, where I learned quickly that no one is coming
        to save you. You either figure it out, or you get left behind. That
        mindset has shaped how I approach everything: work, learning, fitness,
        and the way I help other people.
      </p>
      <p>
        After leaving active duty, I pushed hard into education and tech,
        moving into cybersecurity and cloud work. Along the way I realized
        something important: I don’t just want a job, I want to build things
        that actually matter and give me freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days I’m focused on combining all of that—discipline from the
        military, problem-solving from tech, and hard-earned life experience—
        into tools, systems, and content that help people get unstuck and move
        forward.

    <!-- How I think / values -->
    <section aria-labelledby="values-heading">
      <h2 id="values-heading">How I think</h2>
      <ul style="margin-left: 1.2rem; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
        <li><strong>Ownership over excuses.</strong> If it’s my life, it’s my responsibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Simplify first.</strong> Most people don’t need more; they need less, done better.</li>
        <li><strong>Systems beat motivation.</strong> Build habits and infrastructure so progress is automatic.</li>
        <li><strong>Tell the truth.</strong> To myself, first. Then to everyone else.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

        This site is just a simple landing page for now, but I’m always open to
        good conversations about security, systems, business ideas, or personal
        growth.

        You can plug this into your own contact flow later (email, socials, or a
        form). For now, this button is just here to prove the JavaScript works.
